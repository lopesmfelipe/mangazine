# Project Transition Notice

## Repository Update

As of [Date], this repository has been updated to reflect a significant change in the project's structure. 

### What Has Changed?

To better manage and deploy the project, we have transitioned to using two separate repositories:

- **Frontend Repository**: Contains the code for the client-side (frontend) application.
- **Backend Repository**: Contains the code for the server-side (backend) application.

### Why the Change?

The decision to split the code into separate repositories was made to:
- **Improve Management**: Easier to manage and maintain frontend and backend code independently.
- **Simplify Deployment**: Allows for separate deployment pipelines and configurations for frontend and backend.
- **Enhance Collaboration**: Facilitates collaboration by clearly separating concerns and responsibilities.

### How to Proceed?

1. **Frontend Repository**: 
   - Repository URL: [Frontend Repo URL]
   - Contains the code for the frontend application.
   - Instructions for setting up and running the frontend can be found in the [frontend repository README](Frontend Repo URL).

2. **Backend Repository**: 
   - Repository URL: [Backend Repo URL]
   - Contains the code for the backend application.
   - Instructions for setting up and running the backend can be found in the [backend repository README](Backend Repo URL).

### Project History

The original repository will remain available for historical purposes, including all commits, issues, and pull requests from the earlier stages of the project. This will ensure that the evolution of the project is documented and accessible.
